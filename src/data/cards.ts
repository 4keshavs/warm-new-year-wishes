    title: "The Reflection",
    message: `This year was a rollercoaster, and somehow, you were one of the few constants. Thanks for putting up with my late-night calls, random rants, and questionable life choices. Here's to not changing that in 2025.`
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "The Memories",
    message: `They say you shouldn't look back, but honestly, some of our memories are too good to leave behind. Like that time we couldn't stop laughing about the most stupid thing. Those moments? Yeah, I want more of them.`
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "The Funny One",
    message: `My camera roll is full of memes I saved just to send to you. I hope 2025 gives us more reasons to laugh until our stomachs hurt. Also, I'm sorry in advance for the 3 AM texts you're definitely going to get.`
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "The Sincere Wish",
    message: `Wishing you a year as beautiful as your smile (and yes, I mean that even when you're rolling your eyes at me). May 2025 bring you all the happiness you deserve—and maybe a little extra patience to deal with me.`
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "The Respectful One",
    message: `I know we're doing the "space" thing, and I respect that. But space doesn't mean I care any less. 2025 or 3025, I'll still be rooting for you, even from the sidelines.`
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "The Chemistry",
    message: `Chemistry like ours is rare—like, rarer than actually understanding what our professors say. I don't know what the future holds, but I hope we'll always have that spark, whether it's for jokes or something more.`
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    title: "The Gratitude",
    message: `Thank you. Even for the arguments, the silences, and the weird moments. You've taught me more about myself than you'll ever know. Here's to a year of growth—for both of us.`
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    title: "The Deal",
    message: `I was going to wish for world peace, but let's be real—I'm wishing for you to finally admit I'm the funnier one. Fine, fine. How about we call it a tie? Deal? Happy New Year!`
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    title: "The Growth",
    message: `I'm working on becoming the best version of myself—not just for me but because you deserve someone who matches your energy. 2025 is going to be our year, even if it's just as two people who truly get each other.`
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    title: "The Simple Wish",
    message: `So, here we are. Page 1 of 365. No matter what happens, I hope you know I'll always be just a call away (or maybe a text, because who even calls anymore?). Happy New Year, Shreya.`
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    title: "The Grand Finale ✨",
    message: `For this last card, I'll keep it simple: You're one of the most important people in my life, and that's not changing anytime soon. Here's to us—whatever "us" means now or in the future. Cheers to 2025, and cheers to you. 🥂`
